The line Class.forName(JDBC_DRIVER); is indeed necessary for loading the JDBC driver class dynamically. This step is crucial in Java database programming, and here's why:

Dynamic Loading:

In Java, the JDBC driver classes are loaded dynamically at runtime using the Class.forName() method. This method dynamically loads the class specified by the fully qualified class name passed to it.
By dynamically loading the JDBC driver class, the application can work with different database systems without being dependent on a specific JDBC driver implementation at compile time.
Driver Registration:

When a JDBC driver class is loaded using Class.forName(), it automatically registers itself with the DriverManager. The DriverManager maintains a list of available JDBC drivers.
This registration is crucial because it allows the DriverManager to find and select the appropriate driver when establishing a connection to a database using the JDBC URL.
Compatibility:

Different database vendors provide their JDBC drivers, and each JDBC driver implements the JDBC interfaces defined by Java.
By dynamically loading the JDBC driver class, the application becomes more flexible and can work with various database systems simply by changing the JDBC URL and the credentials, without needing to recompile the code.
This approach promotes portability and compatibility across different database systems.



RESULTSET

ResultSet is an interface provided by the JDBC API that represents the result set of a database query. It acts as an iterator and allows you to traverse the rows returned by a SQL query. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

Data Representation:

A ResultSet encapsulates the data retrieved from a database query. It organizes this data into rows and columns, similar to how data is structured in database tables.
Each row in the ResultSet corresponds to a record retrieved from the database, and each column corresponds to a field in that record.
Iteration:

The ResultSet provides methods to navigate through the rows of the result set sequentially. Common methods include next(), which moves the cursor to the next row, and previous(), which moves the cursor to the previous row.
By calling these methods iteratively, you can process each row of the result set one at a time.
Data Retrieval:

The ResultSet provides various methods to retrieve the data from the current row. These methods are named according to the data type of the corresponding column in the result set.
For example, getInt(), getString(), getDouble(), etc., are used to retrieve values from columns of integer, string, and double data types, respectively.
Lifecycle:

A ResultSet is typically associated with a statement that executed a SQL query (e.g., a PreparedStatement or a Statement). It is created when the query is executed and remains open until explicitly closed by the developer.
Closing the ResultSet is essential to release the database and JDBC resources associated with it.
